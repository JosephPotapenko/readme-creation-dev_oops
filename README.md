ReadMe write-up: 
Problem statement:
    EWU Hospital faces challenges in managing patient records, scheduling appointments, handling staff schedules, and maintaining medical inventories. The distributed nature of current systems makes it difficult for hospital staff to synchronize information efficiently. 

Intended user: 
    EWU Hospital and any/all of its patients and employees. This includes doctors, nurses, lab technicians, billing staff, system administrators, network managers, patients, and any other employees (janitorial, cafeteria, and general healthcare staff.)

Cause of the issue:
    The cause of the problem is the distributed nature of the system. The incoming data comes from multiple sources and the information is not synchronized efficiently because of this. 

Our solution: 
    HealthConnect is a hospital management system designed to streamline operations, manage patient records, appointments, staff schedules, and medical inventories. This new system would unify the diverse incoming data sources which will synchronize information efficiently and do it all in a unified system.
