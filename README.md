ReadMe write-up: 
### HealthConnect 

## Problem statement:
EWU Hospital faces challenges in managing patient records, scheduling appointments, handling staff schedules, and maintaining medical inventories. The distributed nature of current systems makes it difficult for hospital staff to synchronize information efficiently. This would cause a loss of time, and subsequently it will cause a loss in profit.

## Intended user:
EWU Hospital and any/all of its patients and employees. This includes doctors, nurses, system administrators, and patients.

## Cause of the issue:
The cause of the problem is the distributed nature of the system. The incoming data comes from multiple sources and the information is not synchronized efficiently because of this. 

## Our solution:
HealthConnect is a hospital management system designed to streamline operations, manage patient records, appointments, staff schedules, and medical inventories. This new system would unify the diverse incoming data sources into one system taking in these different data sources which will synchronize the information needed efficiently by itself, removing the need of hospital staff to synchronize the information. This will save time and reduce costs.
